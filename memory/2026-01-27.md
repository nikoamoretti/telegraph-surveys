## Rail Conference Company Research

Nico asked me to compile companies attending rail shipper conferences. Worked on two spreadsheets:

### Original Sheet (1Xhv67v-hEC6Lekra8M6eKH2sYbSexrqzqSrX_tmw2F4)
- Added SWARS 2026 shipper companies (82 extracted from 549 attendees)
- Added PNWARS 2025 companies (17 shippers from PDF attendee list)
- Added NEARS past attendees (49 shipper companies)
- SEARS requires login - couldn't access 2025 attendee list

### Shachar's Sheet - "Rail Conferences 2026" (1wDOIaEm3j9yg51Xsh635gSRKUlurwvL_0xQV9KyJkoY)
Shared by Shachar Astor. Has multiple tabs:
- Conferences 2025, Shippers Attendance
- SEARS/PNWARS/SWARS Attendee Lists
- SEARS/PNWARS/SWARS Company Lists
- AITX Leads or Customers

**Added Industry column (D) to:**
- SEARS Company List (122 companies) - used keyword matching
- PNWARS Company List (31 companies) - used Brave search + knowledge

**SWARS Company List enrichment (COMPLETED):**
- 564 rows (353 unique companies)
- All companies now have Industry classification
- Used Brave search, Apollo API, and browser searches

**Revenue Data Added to All 4 Company Lists:**

| Sheet | Rail Shippers | With Revenue | Coverage |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| SWARS | 106 | 78 | 74% |
| SEARS | 24 | 27 | 100%+ |
| PNWARS | 13 | 18 | 100%+ |
| NEARS | 13 | 13 | 100% |

**NEARS Past Company List (457 companies):**
- Added industries for 451/457 companies (98%)
- Used 3 parallel sub-agents to process rows 2-150, 151-300, 301-458
- Added revenue for all 13 AITX companies (UP, BNSF, NS, CSX, CHS, Chemours, etc.)

**Data Sources Used:**
- Brave Search API (hit rate limits frequently - 1 req/sec on free plan)
- Apollo API (returned empty - likely out of credits)
- RocketReach, Growjo, ZoomInfo snippets via web search
- My knowledge for public companies (SEC filings)

**Remaining gaps (~28 SWARS companies):**
