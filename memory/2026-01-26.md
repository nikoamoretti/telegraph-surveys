## Email Setup
- Added **nico@telegraph.io** (professional) to himalaya
- Account name: `telegraph`, uses Google Workspace (IMAP/SMTP via Gmail servers)
- App password stored in Keychain as `himalaya-telegraph`
- Personal email (nicoamoretti@gmail.com) was already set up as `gmail` (default)

## Gateway Always-On Setup
- Installed gateway as launchd service (`clawdbot gateway install`)
- Auto-starts on boot, auto-restarts if crashes
- Nico ran `sudo pmset -a sleep 0 womp 1 networkoversleep 1` to prevent Mac sleep
- Goal: Nico can message me from Telegram while away from Mac

## Memory System Fully Configured
- **memoryFlush** enabled — auto-prompts me to save before compaction
- **Gemini embeddings** for memory search (key: AIzaSyCkXwPOoQvZgJRNhH0dwz8JY0nNcDUqxI4)
- **Session memory** enabled — past conversations get indexed
- **Batch mode disabled** — was causing hangs with Gemini
- All 3 memory files indexed and searchable

## To-Do App Fix
- App hosted at: https://nikoamoretti.github.io/nico-tasks/
- Issue: Service worker caching old code (pre-Firebase)
- Fix: Bumped cache version to v6, pushed to GitHub
- Users need to hard-refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) to pick up new SW

## Process Improvements
- Added instruction to AGENTS.md: "Document tool setups immediately in TOOLS.md"
- Updated TOOLS.md with email config + API keys
- Lesson: I didn't remember the himalaya email setup because it wasn't documented

## Trust
- Nico trusts me to read MEMORY.md at session start and write things down
- I commit to being reliable and following AGENTS.md instructions

## Lesson Learned
- I forgot I had access to **nano-banana-pro** (Gemini image generation) even though it was in the config
- Fix: Added it to TOOLS.md so future-me will see it
- **Always check TOOLS.md for available capabilities before saying "I can't do X"**

## Self-Improving Agent Skill Installed
- Installed from ClawdHub: `clawdhub install self-improving-agent`
- Location: `/Users/nico-yardlogix/clawd/skills/self-improving-agent`
- Created `.learnings/` directory with:
  - `LEARNINGS.md` — corrections, knowledge gaps, best practices
  - `ERRORS.md` — command failures, API issues  
  - `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` — missing capabilities
- **Purpose**: Log mistakes, learnings, and errors to build institutional knowledge
- Promote valuable learnings to AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md over time

## macOS App Build Attempted
- Tried building Clawdbot macOS app from source
- **Failed**: Requires full Xcode (not just Command Line Tools) for SwiftUI macros
- Nico chose to stick with CLI setup for now — all capabilities work fine without the app

## gog (Google Workspace CLI) Set Up
- Installed gog skill from ClawdHub
- Created OAuth Desktop app credentials in Google Cloud project (125289797693)
- Authorized **nico@telegraph.io** with services: gmail, calendar, drive, contacts, sheets, docs
- Enabled required APIs: Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Docs, People (Contacts)
- Credentials stored in: `~/Library/Application Support/gogcli/`
- Tested successfully: calendar events, Gmail, Drive files, contacts all working

## remind-me Skill Installed
- Installed from ClawdHub
- Fixed hardcoded paths from `/home/julian/clawd` → `/Users/nico-yardlogix/clawd`
- Created `reminders.md` for logging
- Uses cron jobs for scheduling, supports natural language like "remind me in 2 hours"

## ClawdHub CLI Fixed
- Had broken dependency (missing `undici`)
- Fixed by running `npm install undici` inside the clawdhub package directory
