## Commtrex Scraping Project

### ✅ California Complete
- Scraped all 91 CA cities successfully
- 243 unique transloading facilities extracted
- Files: `~/clawd/commtrex_data/ca_facilities_complete.json` and `.csv`
- Time: ~10 minutes with polite delays
- Method: Real Chrome via CDP (Moltbot browser tool + Puppeteer)

### Key Learnings
**What worked:**
- Native Moltbot browser tool (CDP access to real Chrome)
- Puppeteer connection via `browserURL`
- JavaScript evaluation for DOM extraction
- Progressive saves after each city
- 1.5 second delays between requests

**What didn't work:**
- HTTP-only scraping (Cloudflare blocks)
- agent-browser CLI (not in sub-agent environments)
- Shell scripts calling external CLIs

### Next: Remaining 48 States
- Have list of all states in `all_states.json`
- Need to extract city lists for each state
- Then scrape facilities for each city
- Same method as CA (proven to work)
